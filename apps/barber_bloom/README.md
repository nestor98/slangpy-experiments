This is a test to see if I can add a bloom pass to the barber poles and remove the per-pixel minimum distance array. That should run faster ??

I copied falcor's [simplePostFX](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor/blob/eb540f6748774680ce0039aaf3ac9279266ec521/Source/RenderPasses/SimplePostFX/SimplePostFX.cs.slang) slang file, see if i can make it work with slangpy
